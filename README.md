## Motivation

As a huge fan of the **Friends** TV show, I wanted to create a script that would provide an in-depth overview of the data related to the show's ratings and votes. This project leverages the *Friends TV Show Ratings and Votes* dataset, which contains updated IMDb ratings and vote counts for all episodes of the beloved series *Friends* (1994â€“2004) as of July 2024. The goal is to analyze and visualize the show's popularity and how it evolved over time.

## Description of the Database

The dataset includes IMDb ratings and vote counts for every episode of **Friends**. It is a comprehensive collection of data, offering a detailed snapshot of the series' reception by viewers throughout its ten-season run. Key elements of the dataset include:
- IMDb ratings (on a scale of 1 to 10)
- IMDb Vote counts for each episode
- Data as of July 2024

## Tools and Technologies Used

This project was built using the following tools and technologies:
- **Kaggle Notebook**: For developing and running the analysis code in an easy-to-use environment.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to process, analyze, and visualize the dataset.
- **Jupyter**: Notebooks: To run the analysis and present the findings interactively.
